            <h1>Hi.</h1>
                <p>When I was in high school, I took a web design class and told myself I'd never touch
                    that <i>boring</i> HTML or CSS ever again. And look where we are now.</p>
                <p>At the urging of my parents, I applied to colleges for STEM. But nearly two years into a Physics degree,
                    I decided to switch my major. I am now pursuing a Graphic Communication degree (with minors in Computer
                    Science and French) from <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/" title="Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo">California
                        Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA</a>.
                </p>
                <p>I have been taking photography seriously since 2017 and since 2018, visual design as a whole (to include
                    UX design). Professionally, I have shot multi-regional events, weddings, and senior portraits. Serving
                    as the interface and experience designer, my team went 3 for 3 as
                    <a href="http://mustangnews.net/slo-hacks-end-inaugural-season-undefeated/" title="Hackathon win 2 of 3 in 2018">
                        first place in university-level hackathons</a> in 2018.
                </p>
            <h2><u>How did I build this website?</u></h2>
                <p>This website is hand-coded entirely from scratch &mdash; except for the back-end (someday!).
                    I initially wireframed the essential pages in
                    <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html" title="Adobe XD product page">Adobe XD</a>, starting
                    from mobile-size scaling up. In late 2018, I began to code it into existence; however, along the way,
                    I realized adjustments needed to be made. At a certain point, I stopped refining my wireframes and opted
                    to morph my vision as the site took it's form.
                </p>
                <p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code website">Microsoft's Visual Studio Code</a>
                    is my IDE of choice for this project, because it allows me to work with the HTML and CSS files side by
                    side as well as edit JavaScript all within the same application. If at some point I integrate Python
                    scripts or my own back-end files, I will still be able to use VS Code.
                </p>
